# Simulation of Mathematical Models

This repository contains code and documentation for simulating various mathematical models. 

## Features

- Implementations of common mathematical models
- Includes simulation and analysis of the Erlang B formula

## Erlang B Formula

The Erlang B formula is used in telecommunications to calculate the probability of call blocking in a system with a finite number of resources (such as telephone lines or servers).


This repository includes code to simulate and visualize the blocking probability using the Erlang B formula.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simulation-of-mathematical-models.git
    cd simulation-of-mathematical-models/teletraffic-models/erlang-b
    ```


## Usage

- Run the Erlang B simulation script `sim_math_erlang_b.py` to compute blocking probabilities for different traffic loads and server counts.
- More usage instructions coming soon.
